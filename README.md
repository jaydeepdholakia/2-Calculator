Welcome to my cheap thrills! Where I exciting new technology like Blockchain and then make a silly Dapp/Project where people will have to spend money for calculating 10+2 üòÖüòÖ

Welcome to 2nd project of [30 Days Of Smart Contract series](https://github.com/jaydeepdholakia/30-Days-Of-Smart-Contract). As you read above, I am going to make a simple calculator Dapp with a UI here. Please don't judge me! I already am doing that for myself!

You can interact with the Dapp here: [Calculator on Blockchain](https://calculator-30dosc.herokuapp.com/)


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jaydeepdholakia/2-Calculator-30DaysOfSmartContract.git
```
```
install all the dependencies of Hardhat. Follow [these steps](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/setting-up-the-environment.html) for it
```
Compile contract

```bash
  npx hardhat compile
```
Follow along the [hardhat tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/) to run tests and deploy contract

Open the React js folder
```bash
  cd client/
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

  Then react app will run on your localhost, and you will be able to interact with app just like you can do with one I hosted on Heroku
